Pwning Pawns
============

This is the only semi-non-trivial program I wrote in high school (that explains
the embarassingly bad pun in the name) and didn't delete.
It was also the first project on which I used git/github.
I had deleted it from github for some reason I can't remember 2-3 years ago,
but now it's back on the net (and probably nobody cares).

Maybe someday I'll write a retrospective on this, or I might even actually improve
it (e.g. by using an actually thought-out network architecture once I learn
enough about network programming to do so, or by integrating the program with an AI).
But I have neither the time nor the interest for this right now.

Old README
----------

This project, a multiplayer chess game written in Haskell, is still unfinished.
It is in a playable state (all the rules of chess are implemented),
but there are still a lot of details to add.
